***
<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of SHARITY, an online donation and project management system, to support the vision and requirements of the JCI Batangas-Balisong chapter in addressing poverty eradication, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1. It aims to enhance fundraising activities and broaden the reach of individuals willing to help those in need. It will provide a reliable, reputable, and efficient platform for donors and creators to contribute to poverty alleviation. The JCI Batangas-Balisong chapter, a non-profit organization, aims to empower young individuals in creating positive change and has the vision to be one of the top-performing chapters in the Philippines. It will address challenges faced by the organization, such as the need for a responsive, user-friendly, secure, and visually appealing application.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sharity" is a dedicated application developed for the members of JCI Batangas-Balisong. This app empowers members to efficiently manage the organization's projects and activities, including monitoring project donations. When members log in to Sharity, they can access a user-friendly dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of all ongoing and completed projects. The dashboard not only displays project details but also includes information about donations received for each project.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dashboard allows members to easily track the progress of each project and the corresponding donations received. They can view important project milestones, deadlines, and the total amount of contributions raised. One of the essential features of Sharity is the ability for members to add new projects with all the necessary details, such as project titles, descriptions, goals, and expected outcomes. Moreover, the app allows members to edit existing projects, ensuring that all project information remains accurate and up-to-date. To keep donors and website users informed, Sharity enables members to share timely updates and announcements about ongoing projects and the impact of donations. This ensures transparency and builds trust with donors, helping them understand the organization's work and accomplishments better.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, Sharity for JCI Batangas-Balisong members offers a straightforward platform to oversee projects efficiently while keeping donors engaged and well-informed about the projects' progress and the impact of their contributions. Meanwhile, the web-based platform caters to donors and admin, handling donation-related tasks and serving as an informational hub for website users. </p>

<h3>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGs)</h3>


![PROJECT G! SDG](https://cdn.imweb.me/upload/S202108243f92708905182/30f66bcbb41c7.jpg)



<p align="center"><strong>Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eradicating extreme poverty for all people everywhere by 2030 is a pivotal goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Between 2015 and 2018, global poverty continued its historical decline, with the poverty rate falling from 10.1 percent in 2015 to 8.6 percent in 2018. Nowcasts suggest that owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global poverty rate increased sharply from 8.3 percent in 2019 to 9.2 percent in 2020, representing the first increase in extreme poverty since 1998 and the largest increase since 1990 and setting back poverty reduction by about three years.</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reversed the steady progress of poverty reduction over the past 25 years. This unprecedented reversal is being further exacerbated by rising inflation and the impacts of the war in Ukraine. It is estimated that these combined crises will lead to an additional 75 millionâ€“95 million people living in extreme poverty in 2022, compared with pre-pandemic projections.</p>
